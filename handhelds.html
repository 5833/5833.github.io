      The Game Boy was the first portable,
      <br>interchangeable cartridge handheld
      <br>by Nintendo. Games were 8-bit black-and-white,
      <br>played on a green-tinted screen. The system had
      <br>a red LED which showed the remaining power.
      <br>It could last for over 30 hours on its required
      <br>4 AA batteries.

The first Nintendo console with 3D graphics,
<br>the concept was to create a virtual reality
<br>experience. The system featured a pair of
<br>goggles to look into which sent a slightly
<br>different image to each eye, creating the
<br>3D effect. The graphics could only be
<br>displayed in red and black. The system
<br>reportedly caused headaches and nausea,
<br>leading to low sales. It was discontinued
<br>less than a year after it was released.

<br>slimmed down version with a monochrome screen
<br>rather than the pea soup screen. It takes 2
<br>AAA batteries and lasts for a little less time.
<br>The first releases of the Game Boy Pocket did not
<br>come with the red LED, as shown in the photo.
<br>Due to high demand, Nintendo added the LED to
<br>the system.

<br>It also had many technical enhancements, including
<br>a more powerful processor and an infrared wireless
<br>link-up port. This system was technically compared
<br>to the NES, except that the Game Boy Color has a
<br>larger color palette. There is no backlight

    The Game Boy Advance was a major improvement
    <br>over the Game Boy Color with a new handheld
    <br>shape, shoulder buttons and better graphics.
    <br>It was technically compared to the Super
    <br>Nintendo console, except that the
    <br>Game Boy Advance's 16-bit sound is not as
    <br>powerful as the console's. Some games remade
    <br>from the Super Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance
    <br>had to remix their soundtracks so they would work
    <br>on the handheld system. This is clearly evident in
    <br>the Donkey Kong Country series.
