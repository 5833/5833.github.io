  <h1>History</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
Nintendo was founded in 1889 to produce handmade hanafuda cards which are Japanese playing cards.
Nintendo was a card company until 1965. Now, Nintendo Co. Ltd. is a Japanese multinational consumer
electronics company. Nintendo is headquartered in Kyoto (Japan) and has become one of the most biggest
names in today's video game industry. In 1983, when it launched the Nintendo Entertainment System,
Nintendo has sold more than 4.5 billion video games and more than 710 million hardware units around the world.

<h2>Disney deal</h2>
<br>
<br>
In 1959, Nintendo made a deal with Disney to allow the use of Disney's characters on Nintendo's
playing cards. Previously, Western playing cards were regarded as something similar to hanafuda
and mahjong: a device for gambling. By tying playing cards to Disney and selling books explaining
the different games you could play with the cards, Nintendo could sell the product all over Japan.
The tie-in was a success and the company sold at least 600,000 card packs in a single year.After
the success in 1963 Nintendo Playing Card Co., Ltd. was renamed to Nintendo.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Taxi’s and toys</h2>
<br>
<br>
Nintendo began to experiment in other areas of business using the newly injected capital.
Between 1963 and 1968, Nintendo set up a taxi company, a love hotel chain, a food company
and several other things. All these ventures eventually failed, except toymaking.In 1964,
while Japan was experiencing an economic boom because of the Tokyo Olympics, the playing
card business reached its ending point. Japanese customers stopped buying playing cards.
Nintendo struggled to survive in the Japanese toy industry. This was the beginning of a
major new era for Nintendo.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Electronic toys</h2>
<br>
<br>
In 1966, the president of Nintendo was observing a hanafuda factory. He noticed an extending
arm, which was made by one of their maintenance engineers, Gunpei Yokoi, for his own amusement.
Yamauchi ordered Yokoi to develop it as a product for Christmas. Released as the ‘Ultra Hand’,
it would become one of Nintendo's earliest toy blockbusters, selling over a million units. Due
to his electrical engineering background, it soon became apparent that Yokoi was quite adept at
developing electronic toys. These devices had a much higher value than traditional toys, allowing
Nintendo to charge a higher price for each product. Yokoi went on to develop many other toys,
including the Ten Billion Barrel puzzle, a baseball throwing machine called the Ultra Machine, a
Love Tester and the Nintendo Beam Gun Game, the first solar-powered light gun which was released in
1970. Then followed the Ele-Conga, one of the first programmable drum machines, the Magnavox Odyssey
(1972) which was the first commercially available video game console. It had a light gun accessory,
the Shooting Gallery. This was the first time Nintendo got involved in video games.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Nintendo Today</h2>
<br>
<br>
These days, Nintendo is one of the biggest companies in the gaming industry. Creating many great and
memorable games, and consoles. Nintendo has been a part of the video game industry for 45 years and are
still standing strong
