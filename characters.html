    <td>Captain N: The Game Master... Like it or hate it, this show made waves for<br>
      being bad in many people's eyes, but also very good to some. The initial <br>
      idea is a kid playing his NES and he gets sucked into a Video Game - When <br>
      he traveled into the video game world, he became his own cartoon and <br>
      helped save the denizens of Video Land. The show was rather short-lived, <br>
      but made waves nonetheless.
      <br>
      <br>
      But back in the day, it was really cool to see some of our favorite video<br>
      game characters in a cartoon, even if they weren't accurate representations. <br>
      Captain N was an original character who traveled into the world of video games <br>
      to try and save a princess from the evil Mother Brain <br>
      (who happens to arguably be the main antagonist in the Metroid series). <br>
      So the ups, and downs of this character is the inaccurate representations, <br>
      but the impressive imagination it took really helped make this more interesting.

      The other main antagonist of the Metroid series. He's an alien dragon of sorts that<br>
      leads the Space Pirates in their conquest of the galaxy. He was in the original<br>
      Metroid game and returned to Super Metroid. Ridley has been a staple of the series <br>
      ever since.
      <br>
      <br>
      Samus however would love to get that bounty on Ridley's rather large head. He's come <br>
      back in various forms over time, such as the dreaded Mecha-Ridley from the Metroid <br>
      Prime series. His trademark roar gets long-time fans pumped for the upcoming battle.

      What can I say? These two are inseperable and make such a good team that they might<br>
      as well be one character. Banjo is a happy-go-lucky bear in a magical world. His <br>
      partner is a rather sarcastic bird that he loves like a sister <br>
      (that's right, Kazooie is a girl!). Kazooie typically rests in Bajo's backpack<br>
      and can fly him around and help him make powerful jumps, as well as laying and <br>
      spitting eggs at enemies.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the first game they set off to rescue Banjo's little sister Tooty from the clutches <br>
      of the evil Gruntilda the witch (who likes to speak in rhyme, for some reason), who <br>
      seeks to Tooty's youth from her and keep it for herself so she doesn't look so gross <br>
      anymore (should you get a game over, you'll see the surprisingly pleasant results).

  <td>
      The main character of the first Earthbound game (technically the second in the Mother series). <br>
      Ironically it didn't really make waves when it hit the shores, but the series developed a<br>
      mass cult fanbase that sprung this series into stardom. Ness uses psychic powers to use magic<br>
      in the RPG he's featured in. Some time later, he surprisingly made an appearance in Super <br>
      Smash Brothers, and the fanbase continued to grow from there. Ness continues to be a playable <br>
      character in the Super Smash Brothers series.

Everybody's favorite pink little puffball. His first game was on the original Gameboy, entitled<br>
Kirby's Dreamland. It was an instant hit and he became a prominent enough character to make it <br>
to Super Smash Brothers, but not before getting his own regular console games. Kirby is known <br>
for the ability to suck enemies up and take their abilities. This grants him with weapons <br>
sometimes, or even the ability to turn into one, such as the Kirby Wheel.
<br>
<br>
The Kriby franchise is still alive and well today but has mostly gone back to it's roots as a <br>
portable series, which is neither good nor bad. He continues to be one of the most powerful <br>
contenders in the Super Smash Brothers series, able to take and use anybody's abilities.
<tr>
  <th colspan="2">Samus</th>

<td><img src="Samus.png"class="Samus"></td>

This would be everybody's favorite space bounty-hunter (unless you're a Star Wars fan as well,<br>
then I guess that statement would be fairly conflicting haha). Regardless, she's known not for <br>
only being such a badass, but the fact that well...she's a she! When the first Metroid game came <br>
out, nobody had a clue, as even the instruction manual referred to Samus as being a male. When <br>
people started beating the game in under a certain time, the world was shocked. Samus was revealed <br>
to be a woman and under her suit, a rather revealing swimsuit.
  <br>
  <br>
Samus quickly rose to fame, as did the Metroid series in general. She has a ton of tricks up her sleeve, <br>
such as rolling into a ball to get into tight areas, arming her arm-cannon with powerful weapons, <br>
and fighting off the evil space pirates, or more recently, the Phazon infestation. Samus has been around <br>
a long time and Metroid: Other M looks fantastic as well, returning partly to the original style of play.

What would this list be without the diminutive electric mouse? Arguably one of the cutest Nintendo <br>
characters ever, he packs a powerful punch behind that cute face. His name literally means <br>
"electric mouse". That being said, Pikachu's special ability is using the power of electricity to <br>
decimate Ash's enemies. He's one of Nintendo's most popular characters and the franchise continues <br>
to be immensely popular to this day. He even had his own game on the Nintendo 64, called "Hey you, <br>
Pikachu!". The game utilized a microphone that could be attached to the Nintendo 64 controller, <br>
though it was rather buggy, to say the least.
<br>
<br>
Also, following the success of the popular Pokemon cartoon, a new game was released called <br>
"Pokemon: Yellow Version" that played out a little more like the TV show. Pikachu became <br>
your mandatory starting Pokemon and wouldn't hang out in a Pokeball, as he hated it in there,<br>
and you'd even run into Jessie and James from team Rocket. Pikachu is the face of Pokemon <br>
and has raked in millions, if not billions for Nintendo.

Originally Mario's arch nemesis, Donkey Kong is a rather large gorilla that used to like to capture <br>
the Princess and carry her off, ala King Kong. What happened with this character is rather unique. <br>
Not only did Mario become popular enough to get his own game series, but Donkey Kong did as well, <br>
starting with the smash hit Donkey Kong Country.
  <br>
  <br>
He loves bananas and the evil crocodile king, King K. Rool loves to steal them for himself. <br>
Donkey Kong must often go on a long journey to defeat King K. Rool and get his special banana stash<br>
back. You'd think he'd hide his bananas in a better place. While popular, he's almost faded into <br>
obscurity now. Though Donkey Kong Country Returns just might change that.

Nintendo's surprisingly popular elven warrior. He resides in the mystical land of Hyrule under <br>
several different honorary titles of in-game legend, such as "The Hero" and "The Hero of Time". <br>
He holds in his spirit the Triforce of Courage, one part of the all-powerful Triforce, which <br>
grants anyone who gathers all three pieces any one wish they desire.
<br>
<br>
The evil king Ganon holds the Triforce of Power, and Princess Zelda holds the Triforce of Wisdom.<br>
Ganon often kidnaps Princess Zelda in an attempt to steal her Triforce and lure Link in with her <br>
to capture his as well, and throw the world into eternal darkness. Link isn't about to let that <br>
happen though, and sets off on a series of quests that take him through time and space to defeat <br>
Ganon and rescue Zelda.

Super Mario Bros.:The man himself, the man who needs no introduction. Making his first appearance in<br>
the highly popular arcade game "Donkey Kong" as "Jumpman", Mario brought us out of another video<br>
game crash with Super Mario Bros., his first full-length video game. He is perhaps even the most iconic<br>
video game character of all. Aside from video games, he's spawned a movie (yep, the movie exists, it<br>
cannot be denied!), a few cartoon series, comics, toys, and the list just goes on. He's recognized from<br>
his signature cap with an "M" in the middle, his blue overalls, red shirt, mustache, and white gloves.
<br>
<br>
He's known for his ability to jump extremely high, particularly while running, and the ability to shoot<br>
fire from his hands after eating a fire flower, as well as getting taller when eating a mushroom. He jumps<br>
on his enemies to defeat them and is on a neverending quest to send Bowser back to where he came from and<br>
save Princess Peach, so that he may feast on the delicious cake she made for him. The series is still running<br>
strong today.
